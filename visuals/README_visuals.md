# Visualizations Overview

This folder contains exported charts generated during the analysis. Each visualization supports a specific analytical question and illustrates patterns in Instagram engagement behavior.

## Funnel Engagement Analysis
This visualization models how audience interaction progresses across sequential engagement stages. It is designed to diagnose where behavioral drop-off occurs within the interaction funnel and to pinpoint which stage represents the most significant loss in audience attention. By modeling engagement as a funnel, I was able to identify which stage experiences the largest drop-off and where content may be failing to hold attention.

## Media Type Performance Analysis
This chart compares average engagement performance across content formats (carousel, photo, reel, video) to evaluate how format influences interaction quality. Rather than measuring success solely through visibility, the analysis assesses engagement efficiency by examining how effectively each media type converts impressions into meaningful actions. This makes it possible to distinguish between content that gets seen and content that actually drives stronger engagement.
